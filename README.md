Virtual reality (VR) is reshaping educational paradigms through immersive experiences.
It can become a great tool in creating interactive environments for complex topics to be
understood in an easier manner. VR mimics the experiences we have in real world into
a virtual world, but without constraints. This project delves into VR-enabled expression
conversion using stacks, a fundamental concept in computer science and Data Structures.
The project proposes a VR application that offers learners an interactive platform to comprehend
the intricate process of converting expressions between infix, prefix, and postfix notations.
Through the VR environment, users navigate three-dimensional spaces to visualize
expression transformations, witnessing real-time changes as they manipulate operands and
operators. By employing stack data structures, learners grasp the underlying mechanisms
that facilitate efficient expression evaluation. This project transcends traditional learning
methods by providing visual approach to mastering expression conversions. Learners benefit
from active engagement, enabling them to intuitively understand the relationships and nuances
of different notations. With its innovative approach, the VR project contributes to the
ongoing evolution of immersive education, empowering learners to navigate the complexities
of expression conversion through stack utilization.
